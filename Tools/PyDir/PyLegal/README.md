# PyLegal & PyAnalyze

## Overview

This project contains two Python scripts designed to aid in forensic analysis and change tracking of directory contents:

- **`PyLegal.py`** – Generates detailed forensic reports of a directory and packages them for archival.
- **`PyAnalyze.py`** – Compares two previously generated archive reports and identifies added, removed, or modified files.

These tools are especially useful for digital evidence preservation, compliance, auditing, and change management.

## PyLegal.py – Directory Snapshot & Report Generator

### Description

`PyLegal.py` inspects a given directory and generates a complete forensic snapshot. It collects metadata about each file including:

- File path (relative to the scanned directory)
- File permissions
- Owner and group
- Size
- Last modified timestamp
- SHA-256 hash

It outputs this data in multiple formats:

- `.json` – Structured data format
- `.csv` – For spreadsheet-style analysis
- `.md` – Markdown formatted report
- `.html` – Web viewable table
- `.raw` – Raw CSV for forensic tools

All reports are then bundled into a `.tar.gz` archive for integrity and portability.

### Usage

```bash
python PyLegal.py /path/to/directory
```

If no path is passed via the command line, the script will prompt for input.

### Output

A compressed archive named like `your-directory-2025-04-26-13-45-00.tar.gz` containing:

```
your-directory-2025-04-26-13-45-00/
├── your-directory.csv
├── your-directory.json
├── your-directory.md
├── your-directory.html
├── your-directory.raw
```

## PyAnalyze.py – Comparison Tool for Forensic Archives

### Description

`PyAnalyze.py` takes two `.tar.gz` archives generated by `PyLegal.py` and compares the embedded JSON reports to determine:

- **Added files** – New files present in the second archive
- **Removed files** – Files no longer present
- **Modified files** – Files whose SHA-256 hashes differ (indicating changes)

It then generates a comparison report in Markdown, JSON, and plain text formats.

### Usage

```bash
python PyAnalyze.py snapshot1.tar.gz snapshot2.tar.gz
```

If not provided via command-line, the script will prompt for the archive paths.

### Output

A folder like `Analysis-2025-04-26-13-50-00/` containing:

```
Analysis-2025-04-26-13-50-00/
├── Analysis-2025-04-26-13-50-00.md     # Human-readable Markdown summary
├── Analysis-2025-04-26-13-50-00.json   # Structured comparison results
├── Analysis-2025-04-26-13-50-00.txt    # Plain text summary
```

## Example Workflow

1. Create a baseline report:

   ```bash
   python PyLegal.py /important/data
   ```

2. After some time, repeat the process:

   ```bash
   python PyLegal.py /important/data
   ```

3. Compare the two snapshots:

   ```bash
   python PyAnalyze.py data-*.tar.gz data-*.tar.gz
   ```
