# Steganography

Steganography is the practice of hiding secret information within an ordinary, non-secret medium in such a way that the presence of the hidden information is not apparent. 
Unlike cryptography, which focuses on making data unreadable to unauthorized users, steganography aims to conceal the very existence of the message. Common carriers for 
steganographic messages include images, audio files, video files, and even text documents. For example, an image file might contain hidden text embedded in the least 
significant bits of its pixel values, allowing the message to remain invisible to the human eye while still retrievable by someone who knows the extraction method.

Modern steganography techniques often combine with encryption to provide an additional layer of security. By first encrypting the secret message and then embedding it 
within a cover medium, steganographers ensure that even if the hidden data is discovered, it cannot be easily interpreted. Steganography has applications in digital 
watermarking, copyright protection, and secure communication, but it can also be misused for covert communication in malicious activities. As digital communication 
continues to grow, the study and detection of steganography, known as steganalysis, has become an important field in cybersecurity.
